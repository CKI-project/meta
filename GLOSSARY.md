* **Patch series**
    * A series of patches sent to a maillist and meant to be applied as a
      whole. Messages belonging to the series usually have number of patches
      in the series and the patch index in the subject, written as
      [INDEX/NUMBER], or [PATCH INDEX/NUMBER], or similar. The patch messages
      have index from one to NUMBER, but the series can also include a "cover
      letter", which has INDEX zero.
